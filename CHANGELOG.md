## 1.0.0-alpha.2 (April 10, 2018)
### Added
- ember-cli-pact can now produce Pact Specification v2 pact files according to the `version` config option

### Fixed
- Modules relying on `@ember/test-helpers` are now only included in the `test-support.js` output, avoiding issues in development

### Changed
- [BREAKING] Pact interaction APIs are now importable helpers rather than being exposed on the test context
- [BREAKING] The `moduleFor`-style API has been dropped in favor of a unified `setupPact` helper
